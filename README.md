# Victor Hugo with comments

Hacked together from Victor Hugo and JAMStack-comments-engine

This is a boilerplate for using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) + [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as your asset pipeline.

Victor Hugo setup to use [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for CSS and JavaScript compiling/transpiling.

This project is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE). Please make sure you understand its implications and guarantees.

 "start": "yarn run build:local && yarn run watch", <-- note gulp server can be used to replace yarn run
